Title: Tic-Tac-Toe Game Assignment for First-Year Computer Science Students

**Objective:**
The objective of this assignment is to implement a simple text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. This assignment will help first-year computer science students practice fundamental programming concepts such as control structures, functions, and basic data manipulation.

**Requirements:**

1. **Game Board:**
   - The game board should be a 3x3 grid.
   - Display the board at the beginning of each turn to show the current state of the game.

2. **Players:**
   - The game should support two players, 'X' and 'O'.
   - Players take turns to make a move.

3. **Moves:**
   - Players should input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').
   - Ensure that players cannot make a move in a cell that is already occupied.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - Declare a winner if any player has three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
   - If the board is full and there is no winner, declare the game a draw.

5. **Game Loop:**
   - Implement a loop that continues until there is a winner or the game is a draw.
   - Prompt players for input in each iteration and update the board accordingly.

6. **Functions:**
   - Break down the program into functions to enhance readability and modularity.
   - Consider implementing functions for:
     - Initializing the game board.
     - Displaying the game board.
     - Checking for a winner.
     - Handling player moves.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling to handle invalid input from players.
   - Ensure the program does not crash if players provide incorrect input.

8. **Color:**
   - Display the "X" marks in red and the "O" marks in blue.
